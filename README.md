# Linear-Regression-from-scratch
Linear Regression using stochastic gradient descent has been implemented from scratch.

## Predict Pressure Level
Given a NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests
of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections. Implemented linear regression
model from scratch using gradient descent to predict scaled sound pressure level.
The various attributes of the data are explained in the file description_airfoil.txt. Metrics like mean squared error,
r2 score have been reported. Experimentation with different learning parameter and different initial regression coefficients 
have been reported in notebook.

## Predict Apparent Temperature
Given a dataset containing historical weather information of certain area, implemented a linear regression model from scratch using stochastic gradient descent to predict the
apparent temperature. Various attributes of data are explained in the file
description_weather.txt. Note that attributes are text, categorical as well as continuous. Metrics like mean squared error,
r2 score have been reported. Experimentation with different learning parameter and different initial regression coefficients 
have been reported in notebook.
